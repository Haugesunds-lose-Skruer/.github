# **Haugesunds Løse Skruer**

**Haugesunds Løse Skruer** is an organization originating from in and around the region of Haugesund. The organization aims to behave similarly to a **Makerspace**, but currently due to a lack of the luxuries of "*having a space*" it cannot work like a traditional **Makerspace** and has to rather focus on making its operations portable.

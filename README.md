# .github
The `.github` repository within an organization on GitHub serves as a central location for storing various configuration files and community health files that are applicable to multiple repositories within the organization. 

Here are some common uses and purposes of the `.github` repository:

1. **Workflows and Actions**: It can contain workflows and actions configuration files (e.g., `.github/workflows/` directory) that define automation tasks, CI/CD processes, and custom workflows to be executed across multiple repositories in the organization.

2. **Issue Templates**: It can store issue templates (e.g., `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory) that provide standardized formats for creating new issues in repositories. These templates help ensure that important information is included in issue reports and make it easier for contributors to provide necessary details.

3. **Pull Request Templates**: It can include pull request templates (e.g., `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) that guide contributors on how to create a well-formed pull request and provide relevant information to reviewers.

4. **Community Health Files**: It can contain community health files (e.g., `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/SUPPORT.md`) that outline guidelines for community behavior, contribution guidelines, and information on where to seek support or get help.

5. **Security Policies**: It can include security policy files (e.g., `.github/SECURITY.md`, `.github/SECURITY_POLICY.md`) that detail how to report security vulnerabilities or handle security-related concerns within the organization's repositories.

By consolidating these configuration files and community health files in the `.github` repository, organizations can establish consistent guidelines, automate processes, and improve collaboration and community engagement across their repositories.
